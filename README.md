# Chess
An old, mostly-functional, PvP chess program that I made a few years ago. Will be useful to tear apart for use in web_chess project.

Pretty sure I made this in 2019-2020. Written well enough that I'll use it for parts in my collab web_chess program.

The game logic, while not tested nearly enought, is sound. But good luck casteling or trying to do en passent.

*Not sure how my former-self expected for the players to tell the difference between black and white pieces as both are outputed as lower-case characters.
